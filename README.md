# shadcn-svelte-template

Skeleton project for Svelte using Tailwind with correct configurations for Shadcn.

Note: Using JS (not sorry) and `neutral` base theme. Can be altered accordingly fairly easily.

See `/routes/+page.svelte` for a simple `block` example with a few pre-added components.

Use `npx shadcn-svelte@latest add {component}` to add new components.

Refer to https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs for anything further.

(Born out of laziness)
